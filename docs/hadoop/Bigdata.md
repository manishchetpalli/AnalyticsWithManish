Big Data is a collection of data that is huge in volume, yet growing exponentially with time. It is a data with so large size and complexity that none of traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently.

## **Types of Data**

- Structured Data: This is data that adheres to a model and is easily searchable. Examples include data stored in relational databases and spreadsheets.

- Unstructured Data: This type of data does not have a predefined model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Examples include text files, images, videos, emails, web pages, and social media posts.

- Semi-Structured Data: This is a hybrid of structured and unstructured data. While it does not conform to the formal structure of data models, it contains tags or other markers to enforce hierarchy and order. Examples include JSON, XML, and email messages with both defined fields and free-form text.

## **What is a cluster**

A cluster, in the context of computing, refers to a group of computers or servers that work together and can be viewed as a single system. These computers, known as nodes, interact with each other to accomplish a common goal. This setup is used to improve performance and availability over that provided by a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective and scalable than a single computer of comparable speed or availability.

## **Vertical Scaling**

Vertical Scaling, also known as scaling up, involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing disk space.

## **Horizontal Scaling**

Horizontal Scaling, also known as scaling out, involves adding more servers to a system and distributing the load across multiple servers.
